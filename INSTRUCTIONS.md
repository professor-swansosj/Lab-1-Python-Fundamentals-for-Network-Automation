# Instructions â€” Lab 1 â€” Advanced Python for Network Automation

## Objectives

- Build and use Python functions, classes, and methods.
- Implement basic exception handling with `try/except`.
- Work with structured data formats: JSON, YAML, XML, and CSV.
- Write logs to file for testing and autograding.
- Organize code into modules and run via `main()` guard.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 (via the provided dev container)
- Accounts: GitHub
- Devices/Sandboxes: Local filesystem + sample structured data
- Technical: - Basic Python syntax (variables, loops, conditionals).
- Familiarity with JSON, YAML, XML, and CSV formats.
- Git and GitHub basics (clone, commit, push, PR).
- Working with Files in Python.
- Basic logging in Python.
- VS Code and Dev Containers (or local Python setup).

## Overview

This first lab warms up your Python automation muscles. You'll refactor simple scripts into structured,
reusable modules with functions, classes, and exception handling. You'll parse structured data (JSON, YAML,
XML, CSV), write logs with the logging module, and output graded markers for autograding. Each function and
class should reside in its own file inside `src/`. By the end, you'll have a clean, modular script that logs
events for testing and serves as your foundation for later automation projects.

> **Before you begin:** Open the dev container, confirm Python runs, and ensure you can list files under `data/` and
> write to `logs/`.

## Resources

- [Python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [yaml (PyYAML)](https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation)
- [xml.etree.ElementTree](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html)
- [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
- [Reading and Writing Files](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files)

## Deliverables

- Script executed from a main file and main() function using imports statements for functionns and classes
- `src/` contains: `parser_utils.py` and `network_device.py`.
- `logs/lab.log` contains required markers and log lines.
- Data files under `data/` (JSON, YAML, XML, CSV) successfully parsed.
- Pull request open to main branch with all artifacts committed.
- Grading: **75 points**

Follow these steps in order.

> **Logging Requirement:** Write progress to `logs/lab.log` as you complete each step.

## Step 1 â€” Clone the Repository

**Goal:** Get the starter locally.

**What to do:**  
Clone your Classroom repo and `cd` into it. Review the provided `data/` files and `src/` layout.

**You're done when:**  

- You are in the repo folder and see `data/` and `logs/`.
- You created `logs/` if it didnâ€™t exist.

## Step 2 â€” Open Dev Container

**Goal:** Use the standardized toolchain.

**What to do:**  
Reopen in container and wait for the first-time install to finish. Verify `python --version`.

**You're done when:**  

- Python prints a version (3.11+).
- Your code is launched in a devcontainer via Visual Studio Code

### **TIP**

You can access the shell of your devonainer easily by selecting the menu item "Terminal" and "New Terminal"
if one is not already launched for you.

## Step 3 â€” Implement `NetworkDevice` class

**Goal:** Model a network device and log a summary.

**What to do:**
Create a `src/` directory and create a file nnamed `network_device.py` in the directory. Create
and impilment a class named `NetworkDevice` complete with the following attributes:

- hostname
- ip
- type

Create a class method for the `NetworkDevice` class named summarize that prints annd logs
basic information about the device. Use `loggging` to include a log message as follows:
`[DEVICE_SUMMARY]: <hostname> (<type>) - <ip>`

**You're done when:**  

- A call to `summarize()` returns a string and writes a `DEVICE_SUMMARY` line to the log.

**Log marker:**  
`[DEVICE_SUMMARY]`

## Step 4 â€” Implement parser helpers

**Goal:** Parse each structured data file safely.

**What to do:**  
In `src/`, create a file called `parser_utils.py` and implement `parse_json()`, `parse_yaml()`, `parse_xml()`, and `parse_csv()`.
On success, logging should log `PARSE_*_SUCCESS`; on failure, log `PARSE_*_ERROR` and return an empty list.

Your functions should have error handling built into to handle the following errors:

- The `open()` function: `FileNotFound`
- JSON module: `JSONDecodeError`
- YAML module: `YAMLError`
- `xml.etree.ElementTree` module: `ParseError`
- csv Module: `Error`

**You're done when:**  

- Running the script produces `PARSE_JSON_SUCCESS`, `PARSE_YAML_SUCCESS`,
  `PARSE_XML_SUCCESS`, and `PARSE_CSV_SUCCESS` in the log. The final execution of your code should not error out.

**Log marker:**  
`[PARSE_JSON_SUCCESS, PARSE_YAML_SUCCESS, PARSE_XML_SUCCESS, PARSE_CSV_SUCCESS]`

## Step 5 â€” Wire up `main.py`

**Goal:** Load data, build objects, and summarize.

**What to do:**  
Create the `main.py` file as your entry point to the program.
In `main.py`, configure logging to `logs/lab.log` once.
Load `data/devices.json` (and other files) using your parser helpers.
For each device, build a `NetworkDevice` and call `summarize()`.
Wrap your execution code in a `main()` function.

**You're done when:**  

- Device summaries are printed and logged.

**Log marker:**  
`[DEVICE_SUMMARY]`

## Step 6 - Impliment the Direct Execution Check

**Goal:** Require that the code is executed directly from the `main.py` file

**What to do:**
Impliment the Direct Execution Check
Include a log message before the `main()` function for `[LAB1-START]`
Include a log message after the `main()` function for `[LAB1-END]`

**You're done when:**

- Your main function only executes if called directly

**Log Marker**
`[LAB1-START, LAB1-END]`

## Step 7 â€” Print + log required messages

**Goal:** Echo required lines for grading.

**What to do:**  
Iterate your parsed data to produce:

- `Interface { interface.name } is { interface.status }`
- `Device { device.hostname } is a { device.location } { device.role }`
- `VLAN { vlan.id } is the { vlan.name }`
After each print, log:
- `logging.info(f"INTERFACE_MSG: {msg}")`
- `logging.info(f"DEVICE_MSG: {msg}")`
- `logging.info(f"VLAN_MSG: {msg}")`

**You're done when:**  

- Terminal shows the three message types at least once.
- Log file includes `INTERFACE_MSG`, `DEVICE_MSG`, and `VLAN_MSG`.

**`loggging` marker to add:**  
`[INTERFACE_MSG, DEVICE_MSG, VLAN_MSG]`

## Step 8 â€” Refactor & tidy

**Goal:** Keep modules clean and imports explicit.

**What to do:**  
Ensure only `main.py` runs the workflow; helpers stay importable and short.

**You're done when:**  

- Code style is clean; modules are < ~100 lines each.

## Step 9 â€” Commit, push, and open PR

**Goal:** Submit work for grading.

**What to do:**  
Commit your changes; push; open a PR targeting `main`.

**You're done when:**  

- PR is open and CI passes.

## FAQ

**Q:** Where should logs go?  
**A:** Write to `logs/lab.log` and include the required markers listed in the README.

**Q:** Why split code into modules?  
**A:** It keeps functions/classes reusable and testing simpler; the main program stays small.

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting & Pro Tips

**Dev container / dependencies**  
*Symptom:* ImportError for yaml, csv, or XML libraries  
*Fix:* Reopen in dev container; verify with `pip list`. If needed, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Wrong data paths**  
*Symptom:* FileNotFoundError when parsing `data/*`  
*Fix:* Run from repo root and use relative paths like `data/devices.json`.

**Empty or invalid JSON/YAML/XML**  
*Symptom:* Parse errors or zero-length data  
*Fix:* Use the provided sample files; validate formatting before parsing. Your error handling should catch this if it happens.

**No logs written**  
*Symptom:* `logs/lab.log` missing or empty  
*Fix:* Call `logging.basicConfig(filename='logs/lab.log', level=logging.INFO)` once, near program start.
